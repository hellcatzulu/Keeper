SQL-based app to help maintain a character sheet. No plans to include character tools.

This app will eventually have two versions: a free version and a paid version. The free will have the content from DND Basic, while the paid, if licensing can be obtained, will have ALL the content from the Player's Handbook, with some extra table data from the DM Guide.
